                <p>I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
                But it's so cold and I don't know where
                I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
                But they won't flower like they did last spring</p>

                <p>And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
                I'm just so tired to share my nights
                I wanna cry and I wanna love
                But all my tears have been used up</p>

                <p>On another love, another love
                All my tears have been used up
                On another love, another love
                All my tears have been used up
                On another love, another love
                All my tears have been used up, up</p>

                <p>And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
                But my hand's been broken one too many times
                So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
                Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose</p>

                <p>And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
                But I sang 'em all to another heart
                And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
                But all my tears have been used up</p>

                <p>On another love, another love
                All my tears have been used up
                On another love, another love
                All my tears have been used up
                On another love, another love
                All my tears have been used up, up</p>

                <p>Oh, need a love, now
                My heart is thinking of</p>

                <p>I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
                But I sang 'em all to another heart
                And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
                But all my tears have been used up</p>

                <p>On another love, another love
                All my tears have been used up
                On another love, another love
                All my tears have been used up
                On another love, another love
                All my tears have been used up, up</p>
